//DOM = Document Object Model
    /*Object{} that represents the page that you see in the web browser and provides you with an API to interact with it.
With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page  */

// DOM is like a bridge between HTML and JavaScript.
