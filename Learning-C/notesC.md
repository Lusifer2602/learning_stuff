Array
 it can store multiple values
 unlike in integer we can store only one number, we can use Array for the following task.
 start with variable name and add square bracket then define its size
  int a[size]={contents}; // we are free to add any number of contents in an  array, like if an array has 10 content defiend then we can also add just 1  or 2 contents into it.

whenever an array is defined it takes sequential location in the memory.Array can be 1 dimensional(only one row), 2 dimensional(in form of rows x columns).

In 2D array :
a[][]={{}{}}
