for when there is an issue with merging two brances or commits : https://chatgpt.com/share/6898f617-1048-8005-b3ad-c66060901c5e

Just do this :
If you're seeing this :
```
On branch main
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 4 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" if you want to integrate the remote branch with yours)
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
- You see this because :
Your local branch (main) has 1 commit that the remote (origin/main) does not have.
The remote branch has 4 commits that your local branch does not have.
So your branches have diverged â€” they each have commits the other doesn't.

use this :` git pull --rebase origin main `
